# Security Notice - Latin Hack 2024

## Current Implementation (Hackathon Demo)

Due to deployment platform limitations with environment variable injection during the hackathon, we've implemented a temporary fallback system for the demo environment.

## Production Security Architecture

In a production environment, VeriChain would implement:

### 1. Secret Management
- AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault
- Kubernetes Secrets for container orchestration
- Environment-specific encryption keys

### 2. Key Rotation
- Automated key rotation every 30 days
- Zero-downtime key updates
- Audit logging for all key access

### 3. Access Control
- IAM roles for service-to-service authentication
- Multi-factor authentication for admin access
- Principle of least privilege

### 4. Compliance
- SOC 2 Type II compliance ready
- GDPR compliant data handling
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data

## Demo Mode

The current deployment includes a `HACKATHON_MODE` flag that:
- Enables fallback configuration for demonstration
- Logs security mode status
- Would be completely removed in production

## Audit Trail

All configuration loading is logged for security auditing:
- Source of each configuration value
- Timestamp of loading
- Platform detection
